# search-v3.html

A high-security search randomizer designed to run locally.
\
V3 because I used to have a `data:` url based randomizer, then I had a SearXNG randomizer in HTML I created as a part of my [chromium hardening guide](https://github.com/RKNF404/chromium-hardening-guide), this is the latest iteration designed to be standalone.
