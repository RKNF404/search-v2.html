# search-v3.html

A high-security search randomizer designed to run locally.
\
\
V3 because it started as a `data:` url based randomizer, then it became a SearXNG randomizer in HTML as a part of my [chromium hardening guide](https://github.com/RKNF404/chromium-hardening-guide), this is the latest iteration designed to be standalone.
\
Still a SearXNG randomizer but I intend to add other engines potentially.
